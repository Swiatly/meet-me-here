# MeetMeHere
MeetMeHere is a simple social networking app that I developed several years ago as part of my engineering thesis project.
It ended up serving me well â€” I successfully defended my degree with it! ðŸŽ“

ðŸš€ About the project
While it's certainly not the best I can do today, after a few years of professional experience (including working with Angular), I would now approach everything quite differently.
Still, it remains a valuable milestone in my learning journey.

ðŸ§  What I learned
Building this project gave me my first real exposure to:
- Backend development using Node.js and Express
- Working with PostgreSQL as the database
- Using Docker to run the database locally
- Understanding what an ORM is, through hands-on experience with Sequelize, which I used to simplify interactions with the database

This project helped lay the foundation for the skills Iâ€™ve built on since then.
